				<h2><em>About Me </em></h2>
				<p> I go by Domi, sounds like Tommy but with a "d". I've gone by this for a long time, because I grew up in a
					town where quite a few people had the same name, so it was less confusing. I'm 26 years old, and I graduated college
					at the beginning of last year. I've been a server since I was 18, and I've been working since I was 16.

				</p>
				<p> I have a dog, that I love very much, and I live with my two sisters and dad. My mom recently moved to Saudi
					Arabia for work, and I miss her like crazy. I don't think I would be here today if I didn't have such a close 
					family. We're small compared to most, but very close to one another.

				<h2><em>Past Experiences </em></h2>
				<p> Other than being a server, I don't have much experience with work. I've been a trainer anywhere I've worked at,
					and have always ended up as one of  the top people at any company that I've been with. Most of the experince I have
					with computers comes from school. I learned how to use SQL and Java, but mainly focused on the over all design of a
					system, as well as how to document the software development life cycles, and about which life cycles work best given
					certain situations and peramaters. 

				</p>
				<p>I have had a few accomplishments that I'm proud of, and they do range all over the place. I've won several tennis
					tournaments, I've won a few talent shows for singing, and I've won a few writing contest as well. I mainly dabble in 
					each of those things, but it was cool testing myself and my abilities. I was also accepted into the Nation Society of Collegiant
					Scholars, which was rewarding since I try really hard to be the best in everything I do. The accomplishment I'm proudest of
					is definitely finishing college though. This is because I'm the first in my family to achieve getting a bachelors degree, so
					I feel like finishing school was really important to my mom and myself.

				<h2><em>Hobbies </em></h2>
				<p> I have quite a few favorite hobbies, other than singing and playing tennis, I really enjoy playing video games.
					A lot of the games that I play are indie games, which I prefer since the stories and animation are usually a little
					more unique or out there. Though, a few of the games I love got picked up by bigger companies after enough hype built
					up around them. I do love a few of the really classic games, espeically ones by Nintendo like Mario and Legend of Zelda.
					I could ramble about video games all day.</p>

				<p> Another favorite hobby of mine is movies. Mainly horror, animation, or sci-fy/fantasy. I like to watch them and then
					analyze the movies. I usually watch videos afterwards or talk with friends to see what various things I missed or how others
					toook a scene or meaning from the film. I also do the same things with books. Other than those hobbies, I would say I'm really
					into cooking food and drinking craft beer. So really, I'm into a little bit of everything.
